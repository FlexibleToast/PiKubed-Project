This repository is pretty much abandoned. I installed AWX (Ansible Tower) in my environment and k3s updated to natively support embedded etcd. Check https://github.com/FlexibleToast/Tower_PiKubed for more up to date code. Even that may be abandoned as I look to switch to k3OS instead of Ubuntu 20.04 as my base OS. When I've reached a point I'm happy with I will update my notes website to one outlining the project at https://pikubed.com
